# Infrared-Remote-DB
A database of any and all remote IR codes I can get my hands on.
I got interested in archiving remotes for the Flippe Zero device. With that device I am cloning whatever remotes I can find and posting the code here in .ir files. These file come directly from the Flipper and can go directly to the Flipper or I'm sure any other IR project. These codes are not mine I'm just posting them for easy reference and use.
